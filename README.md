- **Next active work:** Issue #4 — Cloudflare subscription-safe migration

The protected project history has been rewritten and `main` is the sole live branch. The application tree was preserved exactly across the rewrite. AI Native Quality Gates now perform a normal fresh clone of `main`, require zero reachable accidental `..git/` paths, and run `git fsck --full`. GitHub-managed `refs/pull/*` retain legacy PR snapshots outside normal project branch/tag control; that platform-side dereference/GC item is tracked separately and is not treated as a live project-ref blocker.
