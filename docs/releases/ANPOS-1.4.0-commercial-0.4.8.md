# ANPOS 1.4.0 / Commercial Service 0.4.8

Status: **customer-facing release draft; not publication evidence**.

Commercial service 0.4.8 adds principal-scoped Repository Supervisor billing-account discovery. The MCP server returns only the authenticated GitHub user's own entitlement account plus organization entitlement accounts backed by that principal's active seat assignment and current GitHub membership. Capability decisions are derived from the server-side entitlement ledger; the returned non-secret `billing_account_id` remains a selector and never becomes authorization by itself. Global billing-account enumeration is forbidden.

Commercial service 0.4.8 retains sandbox-backed apply for conflict-free non-empty Repository Supervisor plans and adds the guarded empty-repository initialization path described below. Verified private-template Git blobs are re-materialized server-side, staged into a signed remote-ephemeral artifact channel, transformed only inside an isolated Python 3.12+ sandbox, SHA-256/output-path verified on return, and committed to one expected-head feature branch without forwarding the customer GitHub token to the sandbox gateway. Full-plan merge additionally requires a persisted sandbox receipt digest.

Commercial service 0.4.8 also implements guarded `bootstrap_empty` source behavior for GitHub's empty-repository constraint. After explicit confirmation and sandbox verification, the service creates one deterministic inert `.anpos-bootstrap-seed` root commit through the Contents API, verifies zero parents and exact default-branch head, creates the full ANPOS feature-branch commit on that seed while deleting the seed, and retains PR/CI/merge gates. Any post-seed failure becomes recovery-required rather than silently resetting the plan.

This does **not** claim that the live sandbox gateway is deployed, migration 006 is applied in production, private vendor repositories exist, or production full-plan/empty-bootstrap E2E has passed. Plans containing manual-merge/migration-review conflicts remain blocked.

Commercial service 0.4.8 adds deterministic full Repository Supervisor no-write planning for bootstrap-empty, copied-template bootstrap, existing-repository adoption, partial repair, and active-project upgrade. Plans are bound to the exact verified private-template release and immutable target Git tree, preserve target-only application files and project-specific Requirements 83–96 evidence, and return bounded MCP previews while retaining the complete encrypted plan server-side. Full-mode apply remains fail-closed pending the separately certified sandbox-backed apply runtime. The signed remote sandbox driver and live E2E harness remain source-implemented with live external evidence pending.

Commercial service 0.4.8 includes the GitHub-backed MCP OAuth 2.1 transport and adds the guarded Repository Supervisor write foundation: a dedicated installable Supervisor GitHub App role, encrypted server-issued write-plan ledger, exact expected-head and plan-hash binding, bounded secret/path checks, atomic Git Data feature-branch commits, pull-request creation/re-read, exact commit CI inspection, and guarded merge with resulting-default-branch verification. Marketplace billing/Community App permissions remain read-only and are not widened. Full bootstrap/adoption/upgrade plan generation and production write E2E remain pending.

This patch adds the server-side Plugin Subscription Entitlement Bridge. It keeps Community readiness auditing bounded, derives paid Repository Supervisor access from the existing commercial entitlement ledger, and keeps unimplemented write capability fail-closed.

## Included source capabilities

- ANPOS protocol 1.4.0 release candidate baseline;
- commercial service 0.4.8 source identity;
- Requirements 83–88 AI-native product assurance;
- Requirements 89–96 AI-native governance assurance;
- unified assurance state for Requirements 83–96;
- strict specialized JSON Schemas for product/governance assurance policies;
- conformance coverage through CONF-038;
- child bootstrap initialization for assurance, research evidence, compliance, ADR, AI asset, runbook, audit and risk state;
- split Marketplace App / Vendor Distribution App runtime contract preserved;
- fail-closed customer release provenance and production verification boundaries preserved.

## Child migration boundary

Adopting 1.4.0 must be non-destructive. Existing child repositories preserve application code, approved architecture, CI/deployment behavior, legal/commercial terms and already verified project evidence. New Requirements 83–96 controls are classified by actual applicability and do not become pass evidence merely because the protocol files exist.

## Publication boundary

This note becomes a shipped customer release only after `config/release/customer-release-provenance.json` records the exact canonical source revision/tree, immutable artifact digest, deterministic vendor handoff receipt and publication reference.

Repository certification proves the source/build contract only. It does not by itself prove a customer artifact was published or that an external commercial deployment is live.
